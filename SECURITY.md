## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Security issues can be reported via e-mail to jrd-gh@gerdesas.com
or by opening an issue against the project:

https://github.com/PsychoticNinjaRepo/idlerpg-ng/issues/new/choose

Issues will be reviewed and addressed as soon as possible but as this
is a volunteer project we do not project an SLA for break fixes.
