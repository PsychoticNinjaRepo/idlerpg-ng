This is the changelog for the Idle RPG bot by jotun, jotun@idlerpg.net,
http://idlerpg.net. Entries are written backwards. That is, items at the bottom
of the file were added first, and each subsequent addition is placed on a line
before it. Don't ask me why I do it that way: I do not know.

Thanks for your interest in the Idle RPG! Feel free to contact me with ideas and
comments, or post them in the forum on the website for public view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.1.2: released 6/6/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - applied a user-submitted patch to fix a sprintf() bug (anonymous @ forum)
  - quest() now calls writequestfile() when it completes
  - loaddb() now calls backup() before it starts


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.1.1: released 6/3/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - fixed 2 typos having to deal with die() messages when reading the config
    file (meij, et al)
  - quest() now calls writequestfile() when it completes so that it is
    immediately available
  - loaddb() now calls backup() before it starts so you always have an
    up-to-date backup if your bot mangles your db
  - readconfig() now strips out \r and \n (meij, kylemson, et al)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.1.0: released 6/2/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - added a config file so you don't have to re-setup configuration options
    everytime you upgrade. added a function readconfig() to read this file or
    die() if it cannot be found
  - SIGHUP will now call readconfig()
  - added a DELADMIN command to remove admin status from a username. format:
        /msg bot DELADMIN <account>
    owner account cannot be DELADMINed. DELADMIN may be limited to owner account
    depending on configuration (TGS)
  - added an 'owner' account option. owner cannot be DELADMINed, among other
    things
  - added an 'owneraddonly' option. if set, only owner account can MKADMIN
  - added an 'ownerdelonly' option. if set, only owner account can DELADMIN
  - renamed disablepeval to ownerpevalonly. if set, only owner account can PEVAL
  - added missing command line options for %opts options
  - fq() will limit itself to either 1 message or <= 768 bytes output per call,
    regardless of $freemessages
  - added an option to turn off the sending of the list of users automatically
    logged back in on a bot restart, even if the list < 1 k
  - added an option to limit the penalty a single event can incur, 'limitpen'.
    set to 0 to disable the feature, otherwise is taken to be an integral number
    of seconds
  - Win32 no longer tries to turn terminal echo on/off via "stty"
  - tarball now unpacks files to their own directory instead of .
  - removed unused $v, $debug variables
  - auto-login would not voice users that it logged in even if voiceonlogin was
    set, fixed (wogi, et al)
  - fixed a comment having to do with auto login
  - $rpreport should not have been adjusted by $curtime, but by
    $opts{self_clock} to keep it reliable. this may have caused some loss of
    data as the bot neglected to properly backup its database. so sorry! should
    now be fixed (many)
  - item godsend was removing 10% of item's value instead of adding it. another
    copy/paste error. sorry! (Jim Dew)
  - fixed a bug that resulted in users that caused quests to fail not being
    penalized, as they were set as 'offline' before the bot had a chance to
    penalize them (Jim Dew)
  - added options to define the size of your IRPG grid, 'mapx' and 'mapy' (Rick)
  - team battle now shows roll/sum like other battles (anonymous @ forum)
  - added REHASH command to call readconfig()
  - added an option to define the number of modes per line to use when voicing
    users after an auto login. this variable may be overriden by the server's
    directive (Rick)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.0.2: released 5/30/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - calls evilness() and goodness() should have been checking against the number
    of online evil users and good users respectively, not the total number of
    online users (SickMind)
  - changed max length of auto-login text to 1k before bot will refuse to send
  - fixed a problem with the bot penalizing the kicker instead of the kickee
    when someone was kicked (Preston, anonymous, Soc @ idlerpg.net forum)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.0.1: released 5/29/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - forgot to add some sort of mechanism for setting up admins for new bots.
    whoops. bot will now prompt for an owner's account details if it cannot find
    $opts{dbfile} (Secret, anonymous @ idlerpg.net forum)
  - fixed a typo in the ChangeLog ;)
  - Vayanla noted that there was STILL a time discrepancy for very large games
    (or very slow computers). many thanks to him for his help! this is now
    fixed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v3.0: released 5/29/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - fixed a bug causing RESTART not to work unless the bot's filename happened
    to be the same as its nickname
  - item modifiers as well as time modifiers are now stored in the modifiers
    file. changed name of tlog sub to clog (time -> character)
  - changed database write to every minute instead of every $opts{self_clock}.
    to lower the chance of lost stats, the bot calls writedb() if you request a
    DIE, JUMP, or RESTART. this should cut down on much of the cpu usage
  - added a function writedb() which writes out the bot's db from memory so it
    can be done outside of rpcheck()
  - the team battle code would choose 6 random users to participate in a team
    battle, but would not then randomize these users as far as teams go. that
    is, if a username generally appeared at the end of a keys(%rps) list, and
    made it into the list of 6 random users, that user would always defend
    instead of attacking, as he would be at the end of the list. the list of 6
    users is now shuffled using a Fisher-Yates shuffle, code from The Perl
    Cookbook (by O'Reilly. a really great read!) (Peter Beentje)
  - added a "user alignment" feature. users may align with good, neutral, or
    evil. 'good' users have a 10% boost to their item sum for battles, and a
    1/12 chance each day that they, along with a 'good' friend, will have the
    light of their god shine upon them, accelerating them 5-12% toward their
    next level. 'evil' users have a 10% detriment to their item sum for battles
    (ever forsaken in their time of most need...), but have a 1/8 chance each
    day that they will either a) attempt to steal an item from a 'good' user
    (whom they cannot help but hate) or b) be forsaken (for 1-5% of their TTL)
    by their evil god. after all, we all know that crime doesn't pay. also,
    'good' users have only a 1/50 chance of landing a critical strike when
    battling, while 'evil' users (who always fight dirty) have a 1/20 chance.
    neutral users haven't had anything changed, and all users start off as
    neutral. to change your alignment:
        /msg bot ALIGN <good|neutral|evil>
    I haven't run the numbers to see which alignment it is better to follow, so
    the stats for this feature may change in the future (FishyTowel @
    idlerpg.net forum)
  - added new item, Juliet's Glorious Ring of Sparkliness, item level 50-74,
    required user level 25+, chance 1/40, tag 'h'
  - rather than error when PEVAL produces > 15 lines of output, PEVAL will now
    queue its text if lines of output created >= 4 or size of text > 1k
  - LOGIN command now responds via notice rather than privmsg
  - added "named items," meaning that unique items have a letter appended to
    them, saying which unique item they are. Mattt's Omniscience Grand Crown is
    "a," Res0's Protectorate Plate Mail is "b," Dwyn's Storm Magic Amulet is
    "c," Jotun's Fury Colossal Sword is "d," Drdink's Cane of Blind Rage is "e,"
    Mrquick's Magical Boots of Swiftness is "f," and Jeff's Cluehammer of Doom
    is "g"
  - changed split() on incoming data to split on /\s/ instead of / /; users
    could otherwise register usernames or classes containing tabs, which would
    cause the bot to die when reading the (tab-delimited) database (chris young)
  - changed the SIGHUP handler from '0' to 'sub { };'. should eliminate the
    "Signal handler '0' not defined" warning (too many to list)
  - added an item calamity and an item godsend. if you are calamitized, you have
    a 10% chance of one of your amulet, charm, weapon, tunic, set of leggings,
    or shield losing 10% of its item value. if you are godsent, you have a 10%
    chance that one of the above items will gain 10% of its item value (carl
    wyles @ idlerpg.net forum)
  - %botnick% in $opts{botopcmd} will be evaluated to the bot's current nickname
    to avoid opping another, more evil user when the bot's nickname is in use
  - added an option to give non-admin users limited access to the INFO command.
    when enabled, non-admin users can use the INFO command to learn to which
    server the bot is connected and the nicknames of online admins (mike @
    idlerpg.net forum)
  - added an option to disallow the registration of usernames and classes
    containing "non-printable" characters. it's a good idea to leave this option
    on, as I have had problems in the past with using binary hash keys (TGS)
  - whenever a non-admin players walks over an admin player on the map, he/she
    has a 1% chance to bow ;) (mike stewart)
  - changed sending of WHO and $opts{botopcmd} from numeric 001 to receipt of
    bot's JOIN
  - added an option to disable the PEVAL command for users that want to have
    less than trustworthy admins ;^) (TGS)
  - Run noted that (undernet?) servers allow you a certain number of "free"
    messages before output should be limited to 1 message / 2 seconds. fq() now
    sends as many of these "free" messages as it can, rather than sending only
    one message per call (Run)
  - removed some odd sts("MODE $opts{botchan}"); -- not sure why i put that in
  - added rudimentary netsplit detection, which a) gives no penalty and b) logs
    users in upon return. will pick up quit messages that match
    /^\S+\.\S+ \S+\.\S+$/. if your network (or server) does not prefix quit
    messages with "Quit: " (or some other string), or otherwise disallows faked
    netsplit quit messages, then users can cheat this at their whim. added
    option to turn netsplit detection on or off. added option of how long to
    wait before automatically logging split users out and forgetting they ever
    existed. added sub checksplits() which will iterate over the list of split
    nick!user@hosts, remove those which have expired ($opts{splitwait}), and log
    the user out. would love input on this feature, as i expect bugs
  - HELP command for non-admins is now less helpful. generates one line of text
    containing URL for help
  - attempting to PUSH a user more than their TTL now sets their TTL to 0 as
    well as generating a notice to the admin. successful PUSH now only
    chanmsg()s instead of chanmsg()ing and privmsg()ing the admin
  - $arg[3] changed to lowercased, leading-:-stripped $arg[3] in privmsg block
  - cleaned up more code. changed (most) elses elsifs where appropriate. cleaned
    up some logic. dropped all uses of next(). attempted to add () to function
    calls wherever it was missing
  - private messages and notices to the bot no longer penalize you (mrChewie)
  - changed ha() to find access by username instead of nickname
  - added a finduser() sub to return a logged-in username matching a given
    nickname.
  - changed case of $arg[1] after PONG rather than lc()ing it for every
    comparison (mrChewie)
  - at least 15% of all online players must be level 45+ for the hourly battle
    of a level 45+ player to occur (anonymous @ idlerpg.net forum)
  - fixed a serious bug with the bot not tracking changes to its nick (ie, by
    NickServ or PEVAL) -- this caused all messages sent to the bot to be
    penalized (TGS)
  - added $opts{casematters}, which, when set, will not allow the registration
    of usernames that already exist in a different case (MeBeHere)
  - changed db backup, top players report to every 10 hours
  - added $opts{modsfile}, which is where Time Modifier texts are appended.
    also, tlog() now debug()s and chanmsg()s an error message if it cannot open
    the file (MeBeHere)
  - HOG was only 5-74%, corrected to 5-75% of TTL
  - added an option $opts{self_clock} which is rather like the old $alrmint var,
    except this probably works without exploding if you change it. calamities,
    godsends, etc. should take this number into account when calculating odds
  - added a server list rather than static server. bot should try each server in
    the server list twice before giving up (meij)
  - added a PID filename option, to which the bot will write its PID (meij)
  - added a few more cattle-themed calamities (anonymous @ idlerpg.net forum)
  - added a trailing '!' to godsend() text instead of the drab old '.'
  - added some new quests/calamities/godsends contributed by users. edited some
    old calamities/quests/godsends. please feel free to post your ideas for more
    to http://idlerpg.net/forum.php! (anonymous, Afbc0m, anjira, jv, mrChewie,
    W8TVI, et al)
  - attempted to scale occurences of HOGs, godsends, calamities, and team
    battles. HOGs should occur about 1/user/20 days, calamities 1/user/8 days,
    godsends 1/user/4 days, team battles 1/user/4 days. does this by calculating
    the odds of a HOG as rand(20*86400/clock) < NUMBER_ONLINE_PLAYERS, odds of
    calamities as rand(8*86400/clock) < NUMBER_ONLINE_PLAYERS, etc. this appears
    to work great with at least 10 clients (tested up to 300), but doesn't seem
    to work as well below that. would appreciate input
  - debug information is now written to a file instead of STDOUT. bot now
    daemonizes even though it is in debug mode. added sub debug() which takes an
    argument of text to write to the debug file (yeoj)
  - added new item, Jeff's Cluehammer of Doom, item level 300-350, required user
    level 52+, chance 1/40
  - bot will try to regain primary nickname if he sees it come open through a
    /nick or /quit
  - DELOLD command will removed non-logged-in accounts that have not been logged
    into in more than N days. format is:
        /msg bot DELOLD <N days>
    DELOLD is a p0, admin command (DinTn)
  - added option to enable a STATUS command. this p0 command gives information
    on a user, such as level, class, time to level, item sum, etc. useful for
    those IRPGs that lack a website. format is:
        /msg bot STATUS [username]
    if username argument is not passed, returns information on the user issuing
    command. must be logged in to use STATUS (TGS)
  - possibly added option to choose which local address/hostname and local port
    to bind to. let me know if this does/doesn't work (DARKutz, Brad)
  - added security note to head of file
  - will not send auto-login user list if text > 2048 bytes
  - added $opts{botmodes} which will set the bot's usermode to given string on
    connect
  - removed reset of last login time on auto-login; last login should be when
    user last logged in, not when the bot logged them back in
  - levels after level 60 have a next time to level of (time to level @ 60) +
    (1 day) * (level - 60). levels below 60 have not changed. the exponential
    code was getting a little too heavy by itself (TGS)
  - RELOADDB would log all players out; fixed
  - sts() & fq() check state of socket before attempting write. if cannot write,
    outgoing queue is cleared
  - added new item, Mrquick's Magical Boots of Swiftness, item level 250-300,
    required user level 48+, chance 1/40
  - debug messages are now timestamped. added a few extra debug messages, mostly
    for fun
  - top player report no longer occurs immediately after startup, but every 6
    hours from then on
  - added option to disallow registration of usernames/character classes
    containing ctrl codes (Skill0)
  - changed auto-login code from list to hash. would take several minutes to
    synch to a channel with hundreds of users. now takes < 1s (Vayanla et al)
  - removed the hard-coded "#G7" from the top players list.. whoops :^) that's
    been there for some time now, can't believe no one ever noticed (HaRRo)
  - added option to voice users on login/register. if you +m your channel, this
    will cut down on spam, but won't allow non-logged-in or devoiced/deopped
    clients to talk (pingh, wishes, aphade, et al)
  - added a penalize() sub to make penalties a little cleaner
  - added %quest hash to keep up with active quest info
  - added option to write active quest info to file; this makes it readable by
    outside programs
  - can now specify multiple words for the advertisement ban, or turn feature
    off entirely
  - removed all alarm() code, should now run on any system supporting select(2)
    (including, but not limited to, Win32). should also fix a nasty, terrible
    time drift bug; with the amount of processing done in rpcheck(), the next
    alarm() would come later than expected, awarding the user with idling less
    than he had actually idled. it's a small amount, but adds up to about 205
    seconds difference in the clocks after ~9.25 hours (in my tests; will differ
    from machine to machine). MANY thanks to this bug's reporter, Ville
    Luolajan-Mikkola
  - added CLEARQ command, will clear all items in outgoing message queue
  - INFO shows outgoing queue status, registrations this period, and total users
  - cleaned up options section a little bit, made a few other code clean-ups
  - created this file, ChangeLog.txt. the bot's code was getting too long
  - registrations are now limited to 1 / sec. this should keep floodbots from
    registering hundreds of accounts
  - removed ALERT command
  - removed $opts{admin} array, there is now a field in the db to mark this.
    there is also a MKADMIN command to set an account as having admin access.
    syntax is:
        /msg bot MKADMIN <username>
    there is no way to remove an account's administrator privileges, save from
    editing the database by hand (well, there is PEVAL). so, don't assign this
    lightly. admins have full access to the account under which you run the bot
  - die() call if could not write irpg.db is now a chanmsg() instead
  - added an outgoing message queue. all messages are now output at 1 message /
    second, unless a non-zero $skipq flag is passed to sts(). privmsg(),
    notice(), and chanmsg() calls pass their $force flag as a $skipq flag.
    PONGs pass a $skipq of 1 (LexCyber)
  - fixed a rather huge bug that someone on slashnet noticed. registering
    \001PING\001 (or any other ctcp) would send that CTCP to the channel, then
    penalize any who responded. usernames may no longer include a \001
  - godsends, calamities, and quests were all moved to one file,
    $opts{eventsfile}. quests are prefixed with a Q1 or Q2, depending on their
    type; calamities with a C; and godsends with a G. quests are also prefixed
    by their required coordinates if the quest type is 2
  - fixed a typo in the Dwyn's Storm text
  - changed code indentation to four spaces. reworked a lot of code to fit <= 80
    columns
  - changed QUEST command and quest() output to be a little more grammar-
    friendly
  - item stealing! if you are level >= 20, and you win a battle against a
    player, you have a slightly less than 2% chance of stealing an item from
    them. the 2% comes from a) you have a 1/25 chance to attempt to steal an
    item and b) you have a 50% chance that your item (type is random) is lower
    than theirs. the reason it's 'slightly less than' 2% is because you cannot
    both Critical Strike a user and steal an item, so it's (2 - (1/35))%. you
    cannot steal an item of lower level than your current item (Afbc0m)
  - fixed duration() to show 1 day without trailing 's'
  - re-added report of TTL after battle and after critical strike
  - quest() function now chanmsg()s an error if it cannot open the
    $opts{eventsfile} file
  - INFO command now uses privmsg() force flag
  - added grid! thanks to Joakim @ orkut for this great idea. within the irpg
    world are all of the players on a 500x500 "grid" or map. every second, your
    character has an equal chance to step left, right, or neither, and an equal
    chance to step up, down, or neither. if your character encounters another
    player, you have a 1/(# of online players) chance to battle. also, some
    quests require all characters to reach some point on the map. quest
    penalties and awards have not changed
  - added REMOVEME command for users. if you are logged in,
       /msg bot REMOVEME
    will delete your account. this is a p0 command :^)
  - added NEWPASS command for users. if you are logged in,
       /msg bot NEWPASS <new password>
    will set a new password. this is a p0 command


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v2.4.1: unreleased
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - PEVAL will now error and refuse to send output > 15 lines. this is to avoid
    my own errors


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v2.4+fixes: released 2/20/04
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - items are set to 0 on account creation; they were previous undefined
  - bug with QUEST command fixed; would say no active quest even when a quest
    was active


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v2.4: released 10/13/03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - updated privmsg() function to avoid annoying substr()/uninitialized value
    warnings
  - few small bugs in battling bot fixed. a win against bot awards you with 20%
    of your TTL removed. a loss to bot adds 10% of your TTL to your clock
  - bot's item sum is now the highest item sum of all users + 1 (mumkin)
  - fixed RESTART command to clear alarm() before trying to exec()
  - WHOAMI displays class, TTL (Minhiriath)
  - CALC command removed
  - added notice() function which mirrors the operation of privmsg()
  - SILENT command allows admin to switch bot between 4 modes of silence. in
    mode 0, bot sends all privmsgs. in mode 1, only chanmsg() is disabled. in
    mode 2, only privmsg()/notice() to non-channels is disabled. in mode 3,
    privmsgs/notices to users and channels are disabled. silent mode is also
    configurable as $opts{'silentmode'}, so you can setup a bot in any channel
    without it interrupting the channel with its privmsgs (???)
  - third parameter added to privmsg()/notice(); force flag ignores $silentmode
  - hard-coded check for OKish URLs to bot's 'http:'-style banning now
    configurable (sean)
  - JUMP command no longer penalizes if required argument is left blank
  - BACKUP admin command tells bot to copy $opts{'dbfile'} to
    .dbbackup/$opts{'dbfile'}TIMESTAMP; added backup() function to handle this
  - RELOADDB command allows admin to force bot to reload player database file,
    rewriting all memory. RELOADDB can only be used while in pause mode
  - PAUSE command allows admin to place bot into pause mode. in pause mode, bot
    will update player stats, but will not write database. combined with
    RELOADDB, very effective for updating all players stats through external
    script without taking bot offline. new accounts cannot be registered
    while in pause mode
  - QUEST command (p0) tells the active quest, its participants, and its time
    left to completion
  - ban message for 'http:'-type bans now makes unban-time more clear
  - things have been sped up a bit. random battles for users level 45+ now occur
    every hour. random chance for HOG, Godsends, Calamities, and Team Battles
    were increased by a factor of 5
  - time between quests upped to 12 hours. level requirement for quests upped to
    40+. in addition, must have been online for at least 10 hours to be selected
    for quests. number of persons on quest lowered to 4. quest penalty is now a
    p15 instead of 2% of your TTL. this makes more sense, as users who were very
    close to leveling were penalized almost nothing (inkblot et al)
  - fixed spelling of 'caffeinated' (sean)
  - botchan variable now shows how to join channel with key (Dan)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v2.3.1: released 9/20/03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - fixed bug with item finding; bad logic sometimes resulted in user not
    finding any item (thanks mumkin!)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v2.3: released 8/29/03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Jotun's Fury max level dropped back to 174
  - added the Drdink's Cane of Blind Rage with item level 175-200
  - all time modifiers (battles, HoG, etc) are now written to modifiers.txt
  - function tlog() logs a string to modifiers.txt and returns the string
  - changed WHOAMI to not use $_
  - fixed another bug where changing your nick would prevent you from being a
    candidate for auto-login
  - LOGOUT command added as a p20
  - you may now only be logged in under one character at a time. this will help
    protect the bot from being flooded when a single user signs on under 10
    accounts, then is penalized and warned 10 times. attempts to login under two
    names are not penalized
  - fixed a bug where all of your accounts were automatically logged on so long
    as they shared the same host as you, regardless of whether they were online
    before (on bot restart)
  - there is a 1/20,000 chance of a calamity occuring every 5 seconds. the
    calamity() function chooses a random user, then smites them with bad luck.
    the penalty for a calamity is a random 5-12% of next TTL. users are only
    chosen from the pool of online players
  - there is a 1/10,000 chance of a godsend occuring every 5 seconds. the
    godsend() function chooses a random user, then betters their luck. the
    award for a godsend is a random 5-12% of next TTL. users are only chosen
    from the pool of online players
  - there are now 'quests' -- six level 30+ users are chosen to go on a quest
    at a time. if all six users make it to the quest's end, all questers are
    awarded by removing 25% of their TTL (ie, their TTL at quest's end). to
    complete a quest, no user can be penalized until the quest's end. quests
    last a random time between 12 and 24 hours. if the quest is not completed,
    ALL online users are penalized 2% of their time as punishment. users are
    only chosen from the pool of online players (original idea from Nerje; quest
    ideas from Tristan, brt)
  - quests are read from file 'quests.txt' every time quest() is called. this
    allows you to add or remove quests while the bot is still running. quests
    are not picked in order, but chosen at random from the file
  - fixed bug in PUSH, allowing to push into negative TTL
  - db times changed to ctime format in lieu of scalar localtime() (now
    sortable)
  - added db fields for total time idled; total times penalized for privmsg,
    nick change, part, kick, LOGOUT, quest, and quit; and time account created
  - REGISTER no longer penalizes if you are already logged in and the command
    fails
  - fixed 'http:' checking to only look at message text, not entire string
  - messages passed through privmsg() are split into 450-byte chunks and then
    passed to their target
  - bans put into place by the 'http:' method are now removed after 1 hour to
    prevent filling the banlist. bans are stored in @bans, which will hold at
    most 12 bans to prevent the bot from flooding on unban. after 12, bans are
    still set, but not stored
  - 'license' in header slightly changed
  - battle results now include item sums and the random number rolled for each
    player. format is [roll/sum]
  - bot will try to regain his nickname every 30 mins if it is in use at
    sign-on. added vars $primnick and $opts{'botghostcmd'}. $primnick is set
    to $opts{'botnick'} (which may change) on load, and $opts{'botghostcmd'}
    is a nickserv ghost command string
  - the bot's nick ($opts{'botnick'} and $primnick) cannot be registered as
    character names
  - bot is now a fightable player. his item sum is random 250-650. (someone;
    mail me if this was your idea). chances of fighting him are equal to
    fighting any other player
  - bot now daemonizes when starting (jwbozzy)
  - fixed duration code to use the correct secs/day (drdink/inkblot)
  - added a penalty to Team Battle. players will now receive or lose 20% of the
    lowest team member's TTL (drdink)
  - changed battling to award tie to challenger, not challengee. random number
    is also, now, an integer, not a float
  - every 3.5 hours, a level 45+, online player will battle; this will make it
    easier for high-level users to level
  - added function itemsum() to return item sum for supplied username
  - battle results written to battles.txt are now timestamped (Juliet)

  v2.2.2 (schmolli): released 7/18/03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The changes in this version are based almost completely on a patch sent to
    me by Ed Schmollinger, schmolli@IRC. Many thanks to him for his help! Here
    are his changes:
  - SECURITY: added subroutine mksalt to generate random salt for passwds
  - CLEANUP: added subroutines chanmsg and privmsg to send messages to
    bot's channel and to a specified user, respectively
  - FEATURE: added command line argument processing and removed TEST_MODE
    (TEST_MODE is no longer necessary.)  Part of this includes moving most
    of the variables into %opts.
  - FIX: added check for number of existing players when printing top 3
  - CLEANUP: changed "in:" and "out:" debug message to "<-" and "->"
  - CLEANUP: indented concatenated lines

    removed from any players. there is no chance for critical strike in a team
