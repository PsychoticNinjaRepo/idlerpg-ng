First-time users:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Using your favorite text editor, open the bot's source. Read the file header.
   If you don't agree with the license, please delete the source and remove
   each of your brain cells associated with it. Kthx.
2. Open the file .irpg.conf and edit the bot's options to suit you. You must
   also move this file into the same directory where the bot resides.
3. Run it with: perl bot.filename.pl
4. If you have problems, try running it in debug mode:
   perl bot.filename.pl --debug
   If you cannot diagnose the problem, post to http://idlerpg.net/forum.php
5. Thanks for your interest in Idle RPG!

   If you don't agree with the license, please delete the source and remove
   each of your brain cells associated with it. Kthx.
2. I don't think the irpgdbtool will help you unless you're comfortable with
   Perl, sorry. :/ If you are, though, you can pull the loaddb() sub from the
   bot that you're currently using instead of using the loaddb() supplied in
   irpgdbtool. You'll also need to add code to add in the other missing fields
   that exist in v2.4.
